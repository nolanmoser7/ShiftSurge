# Shift Surge

## Overview

Shift Surge is a progressive web application (PWA) that connects service-industry workers with exclusive restaurant promotions. The platform enables restaurants to create and manage targeted deals while workers can discover, claim, and redeem offers through a mobile-first interface. Includes a superadmin dashboard for platform management.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **For Workers**: Instant access to exclusive deals from local restaurants with simple claim/redeem workflows
- **For Restaurants**: Targeted promotion management with real-time analytics and audience segmentation
- **For Superadmins**: Complete platform oversight with user management, audit logging, and business metrics

**Tech Stack Summary:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite (PWA-ready)
- UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- Backend: Express.js with session-based authentication
- Database: **Supabase PostgreSQL** (via @supabase/supabase-js client)
- State Management: TanStack Query (server state)

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Superadmin System

**Access:** Completely separate authentication flow from regular users
- Login endpoint: `/api/admin/login`
- Dedicated admin routes under `/api/admin/*`
- Role-based middleware ensures only `super_admin` role can access

**Admin Credentials (Development):**
- Email: `admin@shiftsurge.com`
- Password: `admin123`

**Admin Dashboard Pages:**
1. **Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`) - Business metrics and recent audit logs
2. **User Management** (`/admin/users`) - Filter by role (All/Worker/Restaurant/Superadmin), search, and modify users
3. **Organizations** (`/admin/organizations`) - Manage restaurant organizations (future multi-location support)

**Audit Logging:**
- All business-critical actions logged to `audit_logs` table
- Tracks: user signups, promotions created/updated, redemptions, admin actions
- Helper function: `adminStorage.createAuditLogSimple(actorId, action, subject, details)`
- Displayed in admin dashboard with filtering capabilities

**Security:**
- Separate session handling for admin vs regular users
- Admin routes protected by `requireAdmin` middleware
- No cross-contamination between admin and user authentication flows

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Component Design System:**
- Built on shadcn/ui library with Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Dual design language:
  - Worker experience: Vibrant orange-red (`hsl(24 95% 53%)`) with energy-focused UI
  - Restaurant dashboard: Professional deep blue (`hsl(220 75% 45%)`) with data-heavy components
- Typography: Inter for UI/body, Poppins for headings
- Full dark mode support with theme switching capability

**Routing & Pages:**
- Client-side routing via Wouter
- Three main routes:
  - `/` - Landing page with dual-audience hero sections
  - `/worker-feed` - Worker promotion discovery interface
  - `/restaurant-dashboard` - Restaurant analytics and promotion management
- Role-based route protection with automatic redirects

**State Management Strategy:**
- Server state: TanStack Query with infinite stale time (manual invalidation)
- Auth state: Context provider wrapping React Query hooks
- UI state: Local component state (no global UI store currently)
- Form state: React Hook Form with Zod validation

**PWA Implementation:**
- Vite configured for PWA support
- Mobile-first responsive design (768px breakpoint)
- Optimized for installability and offline capability (infrastructure ready)

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Session-based authentication using `express-session`
- PostgreSQL session store via `connect-pg-simple`
- Custom middleware for role-based access control

**Authentication Flow:**
- Password hashing: Node.js `scrypt` with salt
- Session storage: PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- Role-based middleware:
  - `requireAuth`: Any authenticated user
  - `requireWorker`: Worker-only routes
  - `requireRestaurant`: Restaurant-only routes
- Auth state exposed via `AuthRequest` interface

**API Architecture:**
- RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix
- Request/response logging middleware for debugging
- Error handling with standardized JSON responses
- Key endpoint groups:
  - `/api/auth/*` - Signup, login, logout, session check
  - `/api/promotions` - Public promotion feed
  - `/api/claims` - Worker claim operations
  - `/api/restaurant/promotions` - Restaurant promotion management

**Storage Layer (server/storage.ts):**
- Interface-based storage abstraction (`IStorage`)
- Drizzle ORM operations wrapped in reusable methods
- Core operations:
  - User/profile CRUD (workers, restaurants)
  - Promotion lifecycle (create, update, status changes)
  - Claim management with unique code generation
  - Redemption tracking
  - Analytics aggregation (impressions, claims, redemptions)

### Database Schema

**Supabase Instance:** `eopeghiffhenhetwfnfv.supabase.co`
**Connection:** Managed via encrypted Replit secrets (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD)

**Core Tables:**
- `users` - Authentication (email, hashed password, role enum: worker/restaurant/super_admin)
- `worker_profiles` - Worker details (user_id, name, worker_role, is_verified)
- `restaurant_profiles` - Restaurant details (user_id, name, address, logo_url)
- `promotions` - Deal definitions (restaurant_id FK, title, description, discount_type/value, status, max_claims, impressions)
- `claims` - Worker claims (promotion_id, worker_id, code, claimed_at, expires_at, is_redeemed)
- `redemptions` - Simple redemption tracking (claim_id FK, redeemed_at)
- `organizations` - Admin-only table for future multi-location support
- `audit_logs` - Superadmin action tracking (actor_id, action, subject, details, created_at)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- VARCHAR primary keys with `gen_random_uuid()` for universally unique IDs
- PostgreSQL enums for roles (user_role) and statuses (promotion_status, worker_role)
- Direct relationships: promotions â†’ restaurant_profiles (no organization layer in main flow)
- Simplified redemptions table (only claim_id reference)
- Comprehensive audit logging for all business-critical actions

**Database Strategy:**
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** as the single source of truth
- Raw Supabase client queries (no ORM) for maximum flexibility
- TypeScript types derived from Drizzle schema definitions (for type safety only)
- Schema changes executed via direct SQL in Supabase SQL Editor

### Design System

**Color System:**
- CSS custom properties for theme-aware colors
- Separate palettes for worker/restaurant experiences
- Dark mode via CSS class toggle on root element
- Elevation system using rgba overlays (--elevate-1, --elevate-2)

**Component Patterns:**
- Hover states: `hover-elevate` utility class
- Active states: `active-elevate-2` for button presses
- Border treatment: Outline buttons inherit parent background color
- Shadow system: `shadow-xs` for subtle depth on elevated elements

**Responsive Strategy:**
- Mobile-first with 768px breakpoint
- Flexbox/Grid layouts for fluid scaling
- Touch-optimized interactive elements
- Viewport meta tag with maximum-scale=1

### Development Experience

**Build Configuration:**
- Vite for fast HMR and optimized production builds
- Path aliases: `@/` (client), `@shared/` (shared types), `@assets/` (images)
- TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type checking
- Separate client and server build outputs

**Development Tools:**
- Replit-specific plugins for runtime errors and dev banner
- Source map support for debugging
- Hot module replacement in development
- File system restrictions for security
